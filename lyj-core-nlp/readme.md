# NLP Lightweight Engine

This module is a lightweight Natural Language Processing and 
Natural Language Understanding engine for Conversational Interfaces.

This tiny engine is able to recognize intents and entities into a request.

To accomplish this, we does not use machine learning or deep learning, 
but simple metadata (JSON structure) that set semantic engine rules.

This solution allow lyj NLP engine to support as many languages you need 
and is extremely simple to configure and extend.
