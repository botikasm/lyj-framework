#DESKTOP FENCES

##About
I started **Desktop Fences** because I was tired of my confusing desktop.
Disordered desktops affect creativity and productivity, that's true!

**Desktop Fences** is a project based on **lyj** framework and **DesktopGap** project.
I decided to write it in java building everything based on DesktopGap platform because I needed to test DesktopGap :)

##Version
